# Womens-Safety-Security-System
Today, the safety of women in India is widely discussed everywhere. Now it has become a serious problem. The crime rate is skyrocketing. Women are not safe either at home or outside. Female travelers from other countries also find themselves in a precarious position when traveling to India. But these fears cannot stop them from any social activity. There are laws, but there must be adequate security measures that are strictly followed to protect against violence against women. To tackle this problem, we have come up with the solution of building an advanced women's security system. We will be using STM32 (Blue Pill), which will drive the entire system along with a GPS module to send accurate location information to the close users, and a NodeMCU (ESP32) module will be used as an alert mechanism. It will also use a switch button to start the entire system when needed. We will also focus on the fact that the project is cost-friendly and easy to use. This model will assist in defending women from attackers and assisting law enforcement in apprehending them or taking any other required action. It will be helpful to find the victim's present location and send information to the person who can help the person in need or alert the appropriate authorities. This project is affordable and simple to use while attempting to address the problems that were present in the market for security systems at the time.
